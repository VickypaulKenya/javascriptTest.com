  Don't be ignorant, life is changing and you 
  are just ther waiting for miracles to happen.

  <p>Can you imagine moving a huge rock with a single hand.
  that looks amazing but it's just the start.
  <br>Let's now go back to our puzzle, when I say you
  are the blueprint what I mean is, in a puzzle we have pieces
  amd before it become one then it means the missing 
  pieces have to be fixed in their corresponding spaces.<br>
  Did you grasp what am trying to talk about?
  If you didn't get it then you got no time, figure it out

  without knowing  what exactly what we do. That shouldn't make it our 
  mistake, it should keep us focusing for one day we will find our path.</p>
